# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The scheduled-file-writer application is experiencing ECR connectivity issues when ECS tasks attempt to pull Docker images from the ECR registry. The error indicates a connection timeout when trying to reach the ECR registry from tasks running in a private subnet. This feature will systematically diagnose and resolve the ECR connectivity issues to ensure reliable container image pulls.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want ECS tasks to successfully pull Docker images from ECR, so that the scheduled-file-writer application can start and run reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an ECS task is launched THEN the system SHALL successfully pull the Docker image from ECR without timeout errors
2. WHEN the image pull occurs THEN the system SHALL complete within 5 minutes
3. WHEN connectivity is established THEN the system SHALL maintain stable connections to ECR endpoints

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive VPC endpoint configuration for ECR, so that private subnet tasks can access ECR services without internet gateway dependency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN VPC endpoints are configured THEN the system SHALL include endpoints for ECR API, ECR DKR, and S3
2. WHEN endpoints are created THEN the system SHALL have proper security group rules allowing HTTPS traffic
3. WHEN DNS resolution occurs THEN the system SHALL resolve ECR service names to VPC endpoint IPs

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper IAM permissions for ECR access, so that ECS tasks can authenticate and pull images successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ECS tasks execute THEN the system SHALL have permissions to call ecr:GetAuthorizationToken
2. WHEN image layers are requested THEN the system SHALL have permissions for ecr:BatchGetImage and ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer
3. WHEN authentication occurs THEN the system SHALL successfully authenticate with ECR using task execution role

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want network connectivity validation tools, so that I can diagnose and verify ECR connectivity issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic scripts to test VPC endpoint connectivity
2. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the system SHALL include tools to verify DNS resolution for ECR endpoints
3. WHEN validation runs THEN the system SHALL test both ECR API and DKR endpoint accessibility

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want monitoring and alerting for ECR connectivity, so that I can proactively identify and resolve connectivity issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN image pull failures occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including network timeouts
2. WHEN connectivity issues persist THEN the system SHALL provide actionable troubleshooting steps
3. WHEN resolution is achieved THEN the system SHALL confirm successful image pulls through monitoring
