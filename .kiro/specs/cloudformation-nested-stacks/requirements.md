# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current CloudFormation template for the Scheduled File Writer application has exceeded AWS CloudFormation's template size limit of 51,200 characters, causing deployment failures. This feature will refactor the monolithic template into a modular nested stack architecture, organizing resources into logical groups: Networking, Compute, and Application components. This approach will improve maintainability, reduce template complexity, and enable successful deployments while preserving all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to deploy the CloudFormation stack without size limit errors, so that I can successfully provision the infrastructure for the Scheduled File Writer application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the deploy-stack.sh script is executed THEN the CloudFormation deployment SHALL complete successfully without template size constraint errors
2. WHEN the nested stacks are deployed THEN all resources SHALL be created with the same configuration as the original monolithic template
3. WHEN the deployment completes THEN the application SHALL function identically to the original single-template deployment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CloudFormation templates organized into logical resource groups, so that I can easily understand and maintain the infrastructure code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the template structure THEN there SHALL be separate nested stacks for Networking, Compute, and Application resource groups
2. WHEN a developer needs to modify networking resources THEN they SHALL only need to edit the networking template
3. WHEN reviewing the main template THEN it SHALL clearly show the high-level architecture through nested stack references
4. WHEN parameters are needed across stacks THEN they SHALL be properly passed between parent and child stacks

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the nested stack architecture to maintain all existing security configurations, so that the application remains secure after refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the nested stacks are deployed THEN all security groups SHALL maintain the same ingress and egress rules as the original template
2. WHEN VPC endpoints are created THEN they SHALL have identical security group associations and policies
3. WHEN IAM roles and policies are provisioned THEN they SHALL grant the same permissions as the original template
4. WHEN resources communicate THEN they SHALL use the same security group references and network paths

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the nested stacks to handle dependencies correctly, so that resources are created in the proper order without circular dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main stack is deployed THEN networking resources SHALL be created before compute and application resources
2. WHEN compute resources are provisioned THEN they SHALL reference networking outputs correctly
3. WHEN application resources are created THEN they SHALL have access to both networking and compute resource references
4. WHEN any stack fails THEN the rollback SHALL work correctly across all nested stacks

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the template parameters and outputs to remain consistent, so that existing deployment scripts and integrations continue to work without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main template is used THEN it SHALL accept all the same parameters as the original template
2. WHEN the deployment completes THEN it SHALL provide all the same outputs as the original template
3. WHEN existing scripts reference stack outputs THEN they SHALL continue to work without modification
4. WHEN parameter validation is performed THEN it SHALL use the same constraints as the original template

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want each nested stack template to be well under the size limit, so that future additions won't immediately cause size issues again.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN each nested stack template is created THEN it SHALL be significantly smaller than the 51,200 character limit
2. WHEN measuring template sizes THEN each nested stack SHALL be under 30,000 characters to allow for future growth
3. WHEN the main template is measured THEN it SHALL be under 15,000 characters including nested stack references
4. WHEN templates are validated THEN they SHALL pass AWS CloudFormation template validation
